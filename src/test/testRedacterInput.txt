This is some complex input.

It should have some regular sections of text that simply go on long enough to wrap around when put in small containers.

It should have some sections that are
             formatted strangely with
                       strange column
                          structures.

[restrict all]
It should have sections that are always redacted.
[/restrict]

[restrict test:alpha]
It should have sections that are low-security.
[/restrict]

[restrict test:beta]
It should have sections that are higher-security.
[/restrict]

It [restrict test:alpha] should be able to support [/restrict] redacted sections [restrict test:beta] in-line with
[/restrict] other redacted sections, including different required clearances.

It should also strip leading and trailing whitespace for the file, and the restricted sections.
